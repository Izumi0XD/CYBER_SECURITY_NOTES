## ◙ ***Introducing Wireshark***
 </br>
 
# ♦ Wireshark : 
   ⇨ Wireshark is a widely used, open source network analyzer that can capture and display real-time details of network traffic. It is particularly useful for troubleshooting network issues, analyzing network protocols and ensuring network security. Networks must be monitored to ensure smooth operations and security( It lets you interactively browse ***"packet data"*** from a live network or from a previously saved capture file).

### ⍰ Packets ?
   ⇨ In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.

### ⚒️ OSI Model and Packet Generation :
   ⇨ The open systems interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It is based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.

  ⇨ In order for human-readable information to be transferred over a network from one device to another, the data must travel down the seven layers of the OSI Model on the sending device and then travel up the seven layers on the receiving end.


## ◙ Network Protocols :

• TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ⇨ A reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for data transmission.


• UDP (User Datagram Protocol) ⇨ A connectionless protocol used for time-sensitive transmissions such as video streaming or online gaming.


• FTP (File Transfer Protocol) ⇨ A standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and server.
