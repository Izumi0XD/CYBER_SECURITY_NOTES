## ◙ ***Introduction to Cyber Security***
 </br>

### ⍰***What is Cyber Security ?*** : </br>
   ⇨ Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It involves the application of technologies, processes, and controls to safeguard computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption, The main goals of cybersecurity are to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information and assets </br> 
 
 
 ### • ***IMPORTANCE*** : </br>
 
   ⇨ Cybersecurity is essential for protecting our digital assets, including sensitive personal and financial information, intellectual property, and critical infrastructure. Cyberattacks can have serious consequences, including financial loss, reputational damage, and even physical harm.

###  ***◙ Types of Threats*** :

 • ***Malware*** : Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy. </br>

   • ***Phishing*** : Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. </br> 

   • ***Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks*** : A man-in-the-middle[a] (MITM) attack, or on-path attack, is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted themselves between the two user parties. </br>

   • ***Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks*** : In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. </br>


## ◙ ***Concepts of CIA*** :

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) collects, evaluates, and disseminates vital information on economic, military, political, scientific, and other developments abroad to safeguard national security. 

• Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.

• Integrity: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.

• Availability: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

4. Cybersecurity Ethics, Principles, and Best Practices
Ethics: Upholding moral principles in the practice of cyber security, such as respecting privacy and ensuring the ethical use of data.
Principles: Core principles including least privilege, defense in depth, and risk management.
Best Practices: Implementing measures such as regular updates, strong passwords, encryption, and user education to enhance security.
5. Networking Concepts
NAT (Network Address Translation): A method used to remap one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): A protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) that is recognized in the local network.
