basically, we learned how to download vs code in kali

### To install it :
 1. We have to normally download it from the any browser thn locate it in any directory
 2. Open the terminal and go to the directory using ***cd*** command and then run ***dpkg*** command
 3. and we also have to give it the root permissions to acess
 4. we hae to write it like ```sudo dpkg -i ./code_1.87.0-1709078641_amd64.deb``` 
 5. in this dpkg is to unpack the file and ***-i*** is to install the file
