   </br>
   </br>
### ◙ Step-By-Step Guide 



### • 1. First we have to connect it to the TRYHACKME platform for that we have to go to the ***Acess*** in profile and then Download the open vpn file in ***.ovpn*** format.


### • 2. Connect to the Vpn using ***sudo openvpn >file that u downloaded<.ovpn***.

• 3. Open a Different terminal 'Remember not to close the vpn file till the work is done' and scan the Ip that was generated by THM while stsrting the machine and try saving the report by using ***RUSTSCAN*** 
</br>
{ ***NOTE: Rustscan is much more efficient when we have to scan all the port in a fast manner,rustscan is upgraded version of nmap but it dont give all the dtails of open ports so we acn again use nap to scan open ports after we get the open ports from using rustscan*** }
