### ◙ OWASP
   : The Open Worldwide Application Security Project is an online community that produces freely available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the fields of IoT, system software and web application security. The OWASP provides free and open resources. {The Open Web Application Security Project maintains a regularly-updated list of the most pressing web application security concerns.}

#### • OWASP TOP 10

1. Broken Access Control: is a security vulnerability that occurs **when a user can gain unauthorized access to certain parts of a web application or system.** This can include accessing data, modifying content, or performing actions that they should not be able to do. It often happens due to flaws in the design or implementation of access control mechanisms, or mistakes in authentication and authorization processes
2. Cryptographic Failures: Inadequate protection of sensitive data through weak encryption or poor key management.
3. Injection: When malicious data tricks the app into executing unintended commands.
4. Insecure Design: Lack of proper security measures in the design phase, leading to vulnerabilities.
5. Security Misconfiguration: Incorrectly configured security settings that expose the system to attacks.
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Using software with known vulnerabilities due to outdated versions.
7. Identification and Authentication Failures: Weaknesses in the login systems that allow unauthorized access.
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures: Using untrusted software or updates that compromise data integrity.
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Inadequate logging and monitoring, making it hard to detect breaches.
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): When an attacker tricks the server into accessing internal resources.
