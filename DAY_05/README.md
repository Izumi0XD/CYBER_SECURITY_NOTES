### ◙ OWASP
   : The Open Worldwide Application Security Project is an online community that produces freely available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the fields of IoT, system software and web application security. The OWASP provides free and open resources. {The Open Web Application Security Project maintains a regularly-updated list of the most pressing web application security concerns.}

#### • OWASP TOP 10

##### 1. Broken Access Control
  : is a security vulnerability that occurs ***when a user can gain unauthorized access to certain parts of a web application or system.*** <br />This can include accessing data, modifying content, or performing actions that they should not be able to do. It often happens due to flaws in the design or implementation of access control mechanisms, or mistakes in authentication and authorization processes.
  
##### 2. Cryptographic Failures
  :  refers to ***a security issue that occurs when sensitive data is exposed due to improper implementation of cryptographic protocols or algorithms.***
     
  This can include problems like weak encryption, incorrect key management, insufficient randomness, or inadequate authentication measures
  
##### 3. Injection
  : is a type of vulnerability in computer security ***where an attacker can send malicious code through an application to another system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even complete system compromise.*** 
   
  It often occurs when user input is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious code

##### 4. Insecure Design
  : ***It occurs when security is not adequately integrated into the application during the design phase, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited***

##### 5. Security Misconfiguration
  : is an ***error or vulnerability in the setup of code or systems that allows attackers to access sensitive data.*** 
    
  It can occur due to improper security settings, maintenance issues, or using default configurations that are not secure

##### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  : refer to ***using software libraries, frameworks, or other third-party components that have known security vulnerabilities or are no longer actively maintained.*** 
    
  This can lead to significant security risks as attackers may exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control.{basically using framework whose vulnerability is well known}
  
##### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures
  : Weaknesses in the login systems that allow unauthorized access.

##### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
  : Using untrusted software or updates that compromise data integrity.

##### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
  : Inadequate logging and monitoring, making it hard to detect breaches.

##### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  : When an attacker tricks the server into accessing internal resources.
